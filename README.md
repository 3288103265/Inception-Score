# Inception Score (compatible with Tensorflow 1.6+)
While the canonical OpenAI implementation of "Inception Score" for the evaluation of generative models is no longer compatible with new releases of Tensorflow,
a new implementation of it is provided. Also, a bug raised in [https://github.com/openai/improved-gan/issues/29](https://github.com/openai/improved-gan/issues/29) is fixed. This code is fast and memory-efficient, and is written in a way that is similar to the original implementation.
